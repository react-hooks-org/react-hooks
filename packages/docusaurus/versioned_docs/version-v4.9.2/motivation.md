When custom hooks were released by the **React.js** team, I was overwhelmed with excitement watching them show the amount of customization that can now be done with custom hooks. 

So that was a day I immediately decided to build **Rooks as a collection of custom hooks** that I would use for my projects regularly as a freelancer, or as a developer at my day. 

I would use so many components which use the same behaviour over and over again. And I would keep asking myself if there was a better way of composing this behaviour so that I don't have to write the same code over and over again. 

**Building a drop down, a model, or a form etec are all repetitive activities** that we as developers do on a day to day basis, and Rooks is an attempt to help you quickly build components as quickly as you can. I hope this proves as useful to you as it is to me.
