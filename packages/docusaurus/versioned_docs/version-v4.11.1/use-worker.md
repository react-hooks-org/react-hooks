## *Note: Future updates to this package have moved to the main package* [rooks](https://npmjs.com/package/rooks). All hooks now reside in a single package which you can install using

    npm install rooks

or

    yarn add rooks

Rooks is completely treeshakeable and if you use only 1 of the 50+ hooks in the package, only that hook will be bundled with your code. Your bundle will only contain the hooks that you need. Cheers!
